# Community Packages

::: tip
The Meteor community is making great efforts to migrate popular packages to Meteor 3.0.

A [spreadsheet maintained](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1JbUZmJab3owZ9LV71Ubto32YX_QWQljRypJTOQupxL8/htmlview) by [@harryadel](https://github.com/harryadel) tracks the status of your favorite packages and offers opportunities to help.
:::

There are some very popular community packages that do not have a documentation website or only have a readme file.
This section tries to list and add some information about usage, configuration, and examples for these packages.

> Think this section as an `Awesome List`, similar to [`awesome-node`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) or [`awesome-react`](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

Many packages have been consolidated into the [Meteor Community organization](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages). Others are maintained by individual developers or companies.

If you use or have a package that you think would be useful to add to this list, please open a pull request.

Please bear in mind if you are adding a package to this list, try providing as much information as possible, including:

- `Who maintains the package` â€“ how to get in touch to submit issues or questions
- `Why is this package for?`
- `API`
- `examples/guide`
