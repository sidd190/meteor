## What is this package?

`jam:pub-sub` brings three key features to Meteor apps:

1. Method-based publish / subscribe
2. Change Streams-based publish / subscribe
3. Subscription caching

> **Important**: This package expects that you'll use the promise-based `*Async` Meteor collection methods introduced in `v2.8.1`.

## Method-based publish / subscribe
Meteor's traditional `publish / subscribe` is truly wonderful. However, there is a cost to pushing updates reactively to all connected clients – it's resource intensive and will eventually place limits on your ability to scale your app.

One way to reduce the need for the traditional `publish / subscribe` is to fetch the data via a `Meteor Method` but there's a big problem here: the data **won't** be automatically merged into Minimongo and you completely lose Meteor's magical reactivity. Minimongo is great to work with and makes things easy as the source of truth on the client. Without it, you'll need to create your own stores on the client and essentially duplicate Minimongo.

With `jam:pub-sub`, you use `Meteor.publish.once` and the same `Meteor.subscribe` to have the data fetched via a Meteor Method and merged automatically in Minimongo so you can work with it as you're accustomed to. It also automatically preserves reactivity for the user when they make database writes. Note that these writes will **not** be broadcast in realtime to all connected clients by design but in many cases you might find that you don't need that feature of Meteor's traditional `publish / subscribe`.

## How to use it?

## Change Streams-based publish / subscribe
**`Alpha`**

With `jam:pub-sub` and MongoDB Change Streams, you can preserve Meteor's magical reactivity for all clients while opting out of the traditional `publish / subscribe` and its use of the `oplog`. Use `Meteor.publish.stream` instead of using `Meteor.publish` and subscribe using the same `Meteor.subscribe` on the client.

**Important**: Change Streams will work best when the filter you use can be shared. To that end, if you have a publication that includes a `userId`, this package will filter out that condition when setting up the Change Stream because it will result in too many unique change streams. As an example, lets say you have this publication:

```js
Meteor.publish.stream('todos', function() {
  return Todos.find({
    $or: [
      { isPrivate: false },
      { owner: this.userId }
    ]
  });
});
```

When this publication is invoked, it will pull all the `Todos` that match the filter above and then begin watching a Change Stream with this filter:
```js
  { isPrivate: false }
```

For this particular filter, it should behave as you'd expect so you wouldn't need to make changes. However, if you have complex filters involving the `userId`, you'll need to be sure that the behavior you expect remains when using `.stream`. If it's not meeting your needs, you could split the one publication into two publications, using a `.stream` with a filter than can be shared and a `.once` for the `userId`:

```js
Meteor.publish.stream('todos.public', function() {
  return Todos.find({ isPrivate: false });
});

Meteor.publish.once('todos.owned', function() {
  return Todos.find({ owner: this.userId });
});
```

The downside by splitting into two is it could result in over-fetching but the data will be merged correctly into Minimongo.

**Note**: In most cases, you'd likely benefit the most from using `Meteor.publish.once` anywhere you can and using `Meteor.publish.stream` only when you really need it and with a filter than can be shared.

**Note**: If you decide to entirely opt-out of using the traditional `Meteor.publish`, then you'll also want to disable the `oplog` entirely &mdash; add the `disable-oplog` package with `meteor add disable-oplog`.

At the moment, this feature is considered in an `alpha` state. Based on previous [Change Streams experiments](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions/11842#discussioncomment-4061112) by the Meteor Community, it seems that using Change Streams as a wholesale replacement for the traditional `publish / subscribe` could "just work". However, in practice it may be a "Your Mileage May Vary" type of situation depending on the frequency of writes, number of connected clients, how you model your data, and how you set up the cursors inside of `Meteor.publish.stream`. With that said, if you're interested in this feature, I'd encourage you to try it out and share your findings.

## Subscription caching
Normally, when a user moves between routes or components, the subscriptions will be stopped. When a user is navigating back and forth in your app, each time will result in a re-subscribe which means more spinners, a slower experience, and is generally a waste.

By caching your subscriptions, you can create a better user experience for your users. Since the subscription itself is being cached, the data in Minimongo will be updated in the background until the `cacheDuration` expires for that subscription at which point it will be stopped and the data will be removed from Minimongo as expected.

## Usage

### Add the package to your app
`meteor add jam:pub-sub`

### Define a Method-based publication
Define a publication using `Meteor.publish.once` and subscribe just as you do currently. `Meteor.publish.once` expects you to return a cursor or an array of cursors just like `Meteor.publish`.

```js
// server
Meteor.publish.once('notes.all', function() {
  return Notes.find();
});
```

```js
// client
// Since each view layer (Blaze, React, Svelte, Vue, etc) has a different way of using `Tracker.autorun`, I've omitted it for brevity. You'd subscribe just as you do currently in your view layer of choice.
Meteor.subscribe('notes.all')

// work with the Notes collection in Minimongo as you're accustomed to
Notes.find().fetch();
```
That's it. By using `Meteor.publish.once`, it will fetch the data initally and automatically merge it into Minimongo. Any database writes to the `Notes` collection will be sent reactively to the user that made the write.

> **Important**: when naming your publications be sure to include the collection name(s) in it. This is generally common practice and this package relies on that convention. If you don't do this and you're caching the subscription, Minimongo data may be unexpectedly removed or retained when the subscription stops. It's recommended that you follow this convention for all publications including `Meteor.publish`. Here are some examples of including the collection name in the publication name:
```js
// the name you assign inside Mongo.Collection should be in your publication name(s), in this example 'notes'
const Notes = new Mongo.Collection('notes')

// as long as it appears somewhere in your publication name, you're good to go. here are some examples:
Meteor.publish.once('notes');
Meteor.publish.once('notes.all');
Meteor.publish.once('notes/single');
Meteor.publish.once('somethingAndNotes');
```

It also works just as you'd expect for an array of cursors:

```js
// server
Meteor.publish.once('notes.todos.all', function() {
  return [Notes.find(), Todos.find()];
});
```

```js
// client
Meteor.subscribe('notes.todos.all');

// work with the Notes collection in Minimongo as you're accustomed to
Notes.find().fetch();

// work with the Todos collection in Minimongo as you're accusomted to
Todos.find().fetch();
```

Inside `Meteor.publish.once`, `this.userId` and [this.added](https://docs.meteor.com/api/pubsub.html#Subscription-added) can still be used. The added document will be included in the final result data. The rest of the low-level `publish` API will be disregarded, as they no longer fit into the context of a Method-based data fetch.

```js
Meteor.publish.once('notes.all', function() {
  // ... //
  const userId = this.userId;

  this.added('notes', _id, fields);
  // ... //
  return Notes.find();
})
```

### Define a Change Streams-based publication
Define a publication using `Meteor.publish.stream` and subscribe just as you do currently. `Meteor.publish.stream` expects you to return a cursor or an array of cursors just like `Meteor.publish`.

```js
// server
Meteor.publish.stream('notes.all', function() {
  return Notes.find();
});
```

```js
// client
// Since each view layer (Blaze, React, Svelte, Vue, etc) has a different way of using `Tracker.autorun`, I've omitted it for brevity. You'd subscribe just as you do currently in your view layer of choice.
Meteor.subscribe('notes.all')

// work with the Notes collection in Minimongo as you're accustomed to
Notes.find().fetch();
```
That's it. By using `Meteor.publish.stream`, any database writes to the `Notes` collection will be sent reactively to **all** connected clients just as with `Meteor.publish`.

#### Setting the `maxPoolSize` for Change Streams
`maxPoolSize` defaults to `100` which may not need adjusting. If you need to adjust it, you can set it in [Meteor.settings](https://docs.meteor.com/api/collections.html#mongo_connection_options_settings) like this:
```js
{
  //...//
  "packages": {
    "mongo": {
      "options": {
        "maxPoolSize": 200 // or whatever is appropriate for your application
      }
    }
  }
  // ... //
}
```

### Turn on subscription caching
With `jam:pub-sub`, you can enable subscription caching globally or at a per-subscription level. Subscription caching is turned off by default to preserve the current behavior in Meteor. Any subscription can be cached, regardless of how it's published.

To enable subscription caching globally for every subscription:
```js
// put this in a file that's imported on the client at a minimum. it can be used isomorphically but the configuration only applies to the client.
import { PubSub } from 'meteor/jam:pub-sub';

PubSub.configure({
  cache: true // defaults to false
});
```

The global `cacheDuration` is set to `60 seconds` by default. This is from when the subscription was originally set to be stopped, i.e. when the component housing the subscription was destroyed because the user navigated away. If the user comes right back, then the cache will be used. If they don't, after `60 seconds`, the subscription cache will be removed. If you want to change the global `cacheDuration`, change it with a value in `seconds`:

```js
import { PubSub } from 'meteor/jam:pub-sub';

PubSub.configure({
  cacheDuration: 5 * 60 // sets the cacheDuration to 5 minutes. defaults to 1 min
});
```

You can also configure `cache` and `cacheDuration` for each individual subscription when you use `Meteor.subscribe`. For example:
```js
Meteor.subscribe('todos.single', _id, { cacheDuration: 30 }) // caches for 30 seconds, overriding the global default
Meteor.subscribe('notes.all', { cache: true }) // turns caching on, overriding the global default, and uses the global default cacheDuration
```

> **Note**: the rest of the [Meteor.subscribe](https://docs.meteor.com/api/pubsub.html#Meteor-subscribe) API (e.g. `onStop`, `onReady`) works just as you'd expect.

> **Note**: Because the data will remain in Minimongo while the subscription is cached, you should be mindful of your Minimongo `.find` selectors. Be sure to use specific selectors to `.find` the data you need for that particular subscription. This is generally considered [best practice](https://guide.meteor.com/data-loading#fetching) so this is mainly a helpful reminder.

#### Clearing the cache
Each individual subcription will be automatically removed from the cache when its `cacheDuration` elapses.

Though it shouldn't be necessary, you can programmatically clear all cached subscriptions:

```js
import { PubSub } from 'meteor/jam:pub-sub';

PubSub.clearCache();
```
