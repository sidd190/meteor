#### Breaking Changes

##### MongoDB Driver Upgrades

If you're using MongoDB 3.6 or earlier, install the new legacy package:

```bash
meteor add npm-mongo-legacy
```
This will pin the MongoDB driver to 6.9.0 for compatibility.

If you’re on MongoDB 4+, the default [MongoDB driver 6.16.0](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.16.0) is applied automatically.

Please migrate your database as soon as possible to MongoDB 5 onward, as [MongoDB driver 6.17.0](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.17.0) will drop MongoDB 4 support. We’ll keep offering `npm-mongo-legacy` so you can keep getting Meteor updates with your existing MongoDB legacy version.

##### Cordova Upgrade

The Cordova platform has been upgraded to version 14. Refer to the [Cordova Changelog](https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2025/03/26/cordova-android-14.0.0.html) for more details on the changes and migration steps.

####  Internal API changes

N/A

#### Migration Steps

Please run the following command to update your project:

```bash
meteor update --release 3.3.1
```

---

While this is a patch release, Meteor 3.3, a recent minor update, introduced a modern build stack that’s now the default for new apps. Here’s how you can migrate to it.

**Add this to your `package.json` to enable the new modern build stack:**

```json
"meteor": {
  "modern": true
}
```

Check the docs for help with the SWC migration, especially if your project uses many Babel plugins.

[Modern Transpiler: SWC docs](https://docs.meteor.com/about/modern-build-stack/transpiler-swc.html)

If you find any issues, please report them to the [Meteor issues tracker](https://github.com/meteor/meteor).

React Packages Changelog: [react-meteor-data@4.0.0](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data/CHANGELOG.md#v400-2025-06-11)

#### Breaking Changes

- File watching strategy switched to `@parcel/watcher`
    - Most setups should be fine, but if issues appear, like when using WSL with host, volumes, or remote setups—switch to polling.
    - Set `METEOR_WATCH_FORCE_POLLING=true` to enable polling.
    - Set `METEOR_WATCH_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=1000` to adjust the interval.

- `react-meteor-data@4.0.0`
  - Independent from the core, only applies if upgraded manually.
  - useFind describes no deps by default [PR#431](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/pull/431)

####  Internal API changes

- `express@5.1.0` - Depends on Meteor’s `webapp` package.
  - Deprecates non-native promise usage [#154](https://github.com/pillarjs/router/pull/154)
  - Use `async/await` or `Promise.resolve` when defining endpoints to avoid deprecation warnings.

#### Migration Steps

Please run the following command to update your project:

```bash
meteor update --release 3.3
```

To apply react-meteor-data changes:

```bash
meteor add react-meteor-data@4.0.0
```

**Add this to your `package.json` to enable the new modern build stack:**

```json
"meteor": {
  "modern": true
}
```

> These settings are on by default for new apps.

On activate `modern` your app will be updated to use SWC transpiler. It will automatically fallback to Babel if your code can't be transpiled wit SWC.

Check the docs for help with the SWC migration, especially if your project uses many Babel plugins.

[Modern Transpiler: SWC docs](https://docs.meteor.com/about/modern-build-stack/transpiler-swc.html)

## v3.1.0, 2024-11-20

### Highlights

- Upgrade to Node v22
- Upgrade Mongo Driver to v6
- Upgrade Express to v5
- HMR performance improvements
- Bring the `roles` package into the core
- Solve remaining issues with Top Level Await and Reify
- Refactor part of the real-time code in the `mongo` package into TypeScript
- Deprecate `underscore` and eliminate it from packages
- Fix Cordova dependency issues
- Simplify Meteor.EnvironmentVariable and make sure it works in all cases
- Stop using Rosetta for development MongoDB on Apple Silicon
- Test improvements
- Bump `http` package to 3.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

- Express is now at v5 and some it's APIs have changed.

####  Internal API changes

N/A

#### Migration Steps

Please run the following command to update your project:

```bash

meteor update --release 3.1

```

Make sure to migrate userland code to use the new Express APIs:

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html

The MongoDB Node.js driver implemented a significant breaking change regarding operation handling. Applications leveraging `rawCollection()` or `rawDatabase()` methods must now utilize Promise-based syntax exclusively, as the callback-pattern API has been deprecated and removed. This modification affects all direct MongoDB operations previously using callback functions.
