# Command Line
Documentation of the various command line options of the Meteor tool.

---

The following are some of the more commonly used commands in the `meteor`
command-line tool. This is just an overview and does not mention every command
or every option to every command; for more details, use the `meteor help`
command.

## meteor help {#meteorhelp}

Get help on meteor command line usage.

```bash
meteor help
```

Lists the common meteor commands.

```bash
meteor help <command>
```

Prints detailed help about the specific command.

## meteor run {#meteorrun}

Run a meteor development server in the current project.

```bash
meteor run
```

::: tip
This is the default command. Simply running `meteor` is the same as `meteor run`.
:::

### Features

- Automatically detects and applies changes to your application's source files
- No Internet connection required
- Accesses the application at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default
- Searches upward from the current directory for the root directory of a Meteor project

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--port`, `-p <port>` | Port to listen on (default: 3000). Also uses port N+1 and a port specified by --app-port. Specify as --port=host:port to bind to a specific interface |
| `--open`, `-o` | Opens a browser window when the app starts |
| `--inspect[-brk][=<port>]` | Enable server-side debugging via debugging clients. With --inspect-brk, pauses at startup (default port: 9229) |
| `--mobile-server <url>` | Location where mobile builds connect (defaults to local IP and port). Can include URL scheme (e.g., https://example.com:443) |
| `--cordova-server-port <port>` | Local port where Cordova will serve content |
| `--production` | Simulate production mode. Minify and bundle CSS and JS files |
| `--raw-logs` | Run without parsing logs from stdout and stderr |
| `--settings`, `-s <file>` | Set optional data for Meteor.settings on the server |
| `--release <version>` | Specify the release of Meteor to use |
| `--verbose` | Print all output from builds logs |
| `--no-lint` | Don't run linters used by the app on every rebuild |
| `--no-release-check` | Don't run the release updater to check for new releases |
| `--allow-incompatible-update` | Allow packages to be upgraded or downgraded to potentially incompatible versions |
| `--extra-packages <packages>` | Run with additional packages (comma separated, e.g., "package-name1, package-name2@1.2.3") |
| `--exclude-archs <archs>` | Don't create bundles for certain web architectures (comma separated, e.g., "web.browser.legacy, web.cordova") |

### Node.js Options

To pass additional options to Node.js, use the `SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS = '--inspect' | meteor run
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
SERVER_NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect-brk meteor run
```

### Port Configuration Example

```bash
meteor run --port 4000
```

This command:
- Runs the development server on `http://localhost:4000`
- Runs the development MongoDB instance on `mongodb://localhost:4001`

::: info
The development server always uses port `N+1` for the default MongoDB instance, where `N` is the application port.
:::

## meteor debug {#meteordebug}

Run the project with the server process suspended for debugging.

::: warning Deprecation Notice
The `meteor debug` command has been superseded by the more flexible `--inspect` and `--inspect-brk` command-line flags, which work with `run`, `test`, and `test-packages` commands.
:::

### Modern Debugging Approach

```bash
# Debug server with auto-attachment
meteor run --inspect

# Debug server and pause at start
meteor run --inspect-brk
```

### Command Usage

```bash
meteor debug [--debug-port <port>]
```

### How It Works

- Server process suspends just before the first statement of server code execution
- Debugger listens for incoming connections on port 5858 by default
- Use `--debug-port <port>` to specify a different port

### Setting Breakpoints

- Use the [`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) keyword in your code
- Set breakpoints through the debugging client's UI (e.g., in the "Sources" tab)

### Debugging Clients

You can use either:
- Web-based Node Inspector
- Command-line debugger

::: details Node Inspector Console Bug
Due to a [bug in `node-inspector`](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/903), pressing "Enter" after a command in the Node Inspector Console may not successfully send the command to the server.

**Workarounds:**
- Use Safari browser
- Use `meteor shell` to interact with the server console
- Apply the hot-patch available in [this comment](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/7991#issuecomment-266709459)
:::

### Differences from Node.js Flags

The Meteor `--inspect` and `--inspect-brk` flags work similarly to Node.js flags with two key differences:

1. They affect the server process spawned by the build process, not the build process itself
2. The `--inspect-brk` flag pauses execution after server code has loaded but before it begins to execute

### Alternative Approach

The same debugging functionality can be achieved by adding the `--debug-port <port>` option to other Meteor commands:

```bash
meteor run --debug-port 5858
meteor test-packages --debug-port 5858
```

## meteor profile {#meteorprofile}

Run a performance profile for your Meteor application to analyze build and bundling performance.

```bash
meteor profile [<meteor-run-options>...]
```

::: info Availability
This command is available from Meteor 3.2 and newer.
:::

### Usage

This command monitors the bundler process and tracks key performance metrics to help analyze build and bundling performance.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--size` | Monitor both bundle runtime and size |
| `--size-only` | Monitor only the bundle size |

::: info
All other options from `meteor run` are also supported (e.g., `--settings`, `--exclude-archs`).
:::

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `METEOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` | Set a timeout for profiling | 90 seconds |
| `METEOR_CLIENT_ENTRYPOINT=<path>` | Set a custom client entrypoint | From package.json |
| `METEOR_SERVER_ENTRYPOINT=<path>` | Set a custom server entrypoint | From package.json |
| `METEOR_LOG_DIR=<path>` | Set a custom log directory | Default log directory |

::: tip
The default timeout (90s) is usually enough for each build step to complete. If you encounter errors due to early exits, increase the `METEOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT` value.
:::

### Example Usage

```bash
# Basic profile
meteor profile

# Monitor bundle size only
meteor profile --size-only

# Profile with custom settings and timeout
METEOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT=120 meteor profile --settings settings.json

# Profile with custom entrypoints
METEOR_CLIENT_ENTRYPOINT=client/main.js METEOR_SERVER_ENTRYPOINT=server/main.js meteor profile
```

::: details Customizing the Profiling Process
You can pass any option that works with `meteor run` to customize the profiling process. This allows you to profile your application under specific conditions that match your deployment environment.

##  meteor generate  {meteorgenerate}

``meteor generate`` is a command for generating scaffolds for your current project. When ran without arguments, it will ask
you what is the name of the model you want to generate, if you do want methods for your api and publications. It can be
used as a command line only operation as well.

> _Important to note:_
> By default, the generator will use JavaScript but if it detects that you have a
``tsconfig.json`` file in your project, it will use TypeScript instead.

running
```bash
meteor generate customer

```

It will generate the following code in ``/imports/api``
![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 28 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70247653/200856551-71c100f5-8714-4b34-9678-4f08780dcc8b.png)

That will have the following code:


### collection.js {meteorgenerate-collection.js}

```js
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';

export const CustomerCollection = new Mongo.Collection('customer');
```



### methods.js {meteorgenerate-methods.js}

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { check } from 'meteor/check';
import { CustomerCollection } from './collection';

export async function create(data) {
  return CustomerCollection.insertAsync({ ...data });
}

export async function update(_id, data) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.updateAsync(_id, { ...data });
}

export async function remove(_id) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.removeAsync(_id);
}

export async function findById(_id) {
  check(_id, String);
  return CustomerCollection.findOneAsync(_id);
}

Meteor.methods({
  'Customer.create': create,
  'Customer.update': update,
  'Customer.remove': remove,
  'Customer.find': findById
});
```



### publication.js {meteorgenerate-publication.js}

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { CustomerCollection } from './collection';

Meteor.publish('allCustomers', function publishCustomers() {
  return CustomerCollection.find({});
});
```




### index.js {meteorgenerate-index.js}

```js
export * from './collection';
export * from './methods';
export * from './publications';
```

Also, there is the same version of these methods using TypeScript, that will be shown bellow.

### path option {meteorgenerate-path}

If you want to create in another path, you can use the ``--path`` option in order to select where to place this boilerplate.
It will generate the model in that path. Note that is used TypeScript in this example.

```bash

meteor generate another-customer --path=server/admin

```

It will generate in ``server/admin`` the another-client code:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 32 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70247653/200857560-a4874e4c-1078-4b7a-9381-4c6590d2f63b.png)


### collection.ts {meteorgenerate-collection.ts}

```typescript
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';

export type AnotherCustomer = {
  _id?: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

export const AnotherCustomerCollection = new Mongo.Collection<AnotherCustomer>('another-customer');
```

### methods.ts {meteorgenerate-methods.ts}

```typescript
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';
import { check } from 'meteor/check';
import { AnotherCustomer, AnotherCustomerCollection } from './collection';

export async function create(data: AnotherCustomer) {
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.insertAsync({ ...data });
}

export async function update(_id: string, data: Mongo.Modifier<AnotherCustomer>) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.updateAsync(_id, { ...data });
}

export async function remove(_id: string) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.removeAsync(_id);
}

export async function findById(_id: string) {
  check(_id, String);
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.findOneAsync(_id);
}

Meteor.methods({
  'AnotherCustomer.create': create,
  'AnotherCustomer.update': update,
  'AnotherCustomer.remove': remove,
  'AnotherCustomer.find': findById
});
```



### publications.ts {meteorgenerate-publications.ts}

```typescript
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { AnotherCustomerCollection } from './collection';

Meteor.publish('allAnotherCustomers', function publishAnotherCustomers() {
  return AnotherCustomerCollection.find({});
});
```



### index.ts {meteorgenerate-index.ts}

```typescript
export * from './collection';
export * from './methods';
export * from './publications';
```

###  Using your own template  {meteorgenerate-templating}

`--templatePath`

```bash
meteor generate feed --templatePath=/scaffolds-ts
```
![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 42 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70247653/200860178-2341befe-bcfd-422f-a4bd-7c9918abfd97.png)

> Note that this is not a CLI framework inside meteor but just giving some solutions for really common problems out of the box.
> Check out Yargs, Inquirer or Commander for more information about CLI frameworks.


You can use your own templates for scaffolding your specific workloads. To do that, you should pass in a template directory URL so that it can copy it with its changes.

###  How to rename things? {meteorgenerate-template-rename}

Out of the box is provided a few functions such as replacing ``$$name$$``, ``$$PascalName$$`` and ``$$camelName$$``

these replacements come from this function:

_Note that scaffoldName is the name that you have passed as argument_

```js
const transformName = (name) => {
    return name.replace(/\$\$name\$\$|\$\$PascalName\$\$|\$\$camelName\$\$/g, function (substring, args) {
      if (substring === '$$name$$') return scaffoldName;
      if (substring === '$$PascalName$$') return toPascalCase(scaffoldName);
      if (substring === '$$camelName$$') return toCamelCase(scaffoldName);
    })
  }
```

###  How to bring your own templates?  {meteorgenerate-template-faq}

`--replaceFn`

There is an option called ``--replaceFn`` that when you pass in given a .js file with two functions it will override all templating that we have defaulted to use your given function.
_example of a replacer file_
```js
export function transformFilename(scaffoldName, filename) {
  console.log(scaffoldName, filename);
  return filename
}

export function transformContents(scaffoldName, contents, fileName) {
  console.log(fileName, contents);
  return contents
}
```
If you run your command like this:

```bash
 meteor generate feed --replaceFn=/fn/replace.js
```
It will generate files full of ``$$PascalCase$$``using the meteor provided templates.

A better example of this feature would be the following js file:
```js
const toPascalCase = (str) => {
  if(!str.includes('-')) return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
  else return str.split('-').map(toPascalCase).join('');
}
const toCamelCase = (str) => {
  if(!str.includes('-')) return str.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + str.slice(1);
  else return str.split('-').map(toPascalCase).join('');
}

const transformName = (scaffoldName, str) => {
    return str.replace(/\$\$name\$\$|\$\$PascalName\$\$|\$\$camelName\$\$/g, function (substring, args) {
      if (substring === '$$name$$') return scaffoldName;
      if (substring === '$$PascalName$$') return toPascalCase(scaffoldName);
      if (substring === '$$camelName$$') return toCamelCase(scaffoldName);
    })

}

export function transformFilename(scaffoldName, filename) {
  return transformName(scaffoldName, filename);
}

export function transformContents(scaffoldName, contents, fileName) {
  return transformName(scaffoldName, contents);
}
```

## meteor login / logout {meteorloginlogout}

Log in and out of your account using Meteor's authentication system.

You can pass `METEOR_SESSION_FILE=token.json` before `meteor login` to generate
a login session token so you don't have to share your login credentials with
third-party service providers.

Once you have your account you can log in and log out from the command line, and
check your username with `meteor whoami`.

## meteor deploy _site_ {#meteordeploy}

Deploys the project in your current directory to [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/galaxy).

### Basic Deployment

meteor deploy your-app.meteorapp.com
```

### Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--delete`, `-D` | Permanently delete this deployment |
| `--debug` | Deploy in debug mode (don't minify, etc.) |
| `--settings`, `-s <file>` | Set optional data for Meteor.settings |
| `--free` | Deploy as a free app (with limitations) |

| `--plan <plan>` | Set app plan: `professional`, `essentials`, or `free` |
| `--container-size <size>` | Set container size: `tiny`, `compact`, `standard`, `double`, `quad`, `octa`, or `dozen` |
| `--owner` | Specify organization or user account to deploy to |
| `--cache-build` | Reuse the build if the git commit hash is the same |

| `--no-wait` | Exit after code upload instead of waiting for deploy to complete |

### Free Deployment

Deploy a free app with MongoDB using:

```bash
meteor deploy your-app.meteorapp.com --free --mongo
```

::: tip Quick Start
The combination of `--free` and `--mongo` is the fastest way to deploy an app without any additional configuration.
:::

#### Free App Limitations

- **Domain**: Must use a Meteor domain (`.meteorapp.com`, `.au.meteorapp.com`, or `.eu.meteorapp.com`)
- **Cold Start**: App stops after 30 minutes of inactivity and restarts on next connection
- **Resources**: Limited to one Tiny container (not recommended for production use)


### MongoDB Options

#### Shared MongoDB (Free)

The `--mongo` option creates a database in Galaxy's shared cluster:

- On first deploy, you'll receive your MongoDB URI in the console
- The URI is also visible in your app's version details in Galaxy
- You must create at least one document to fully instantiate the database
- The database can be accessed using any MongoDB client with the provided URI

::: warning
Free shared MongoDB is not recommended for production applications. The shared cluster doesn't provide backups or restoration resources.
:::

#### MongoDB Connection Settings

When connecting to the free MongoDB shared cluster using your own settings, include:

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "mongo": {
      "options": {
        "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

::: details Why is this needed?
This is necessary because the database provider doesn't have certificates installed on every machine. More about this option [here](../api/collections.html#mongo_connection_options_settings).
:::

### Important Notes

- Settings persist between deployments unless explicitly changed
- Your project should be a git repository (commit hash is used to track code changes)
- Free apps and MongoDB shared hosting are not recommended for production use
- Meteor Software reserves the right to stop or remove applications that abuse the free plan

::: info Version Compatibility
- `--free` and `--mongo` options were introduced in Meteor 2.0
- `--plan` option was introduced in Meteor 2.1
- `--container-size` option was introduced in Meteor 2.4.1
- `--cache-build` option is available since Meteor 1.11
:::

## meteor update {meteorupdate}

Attempts to bring you to the latest version of Meteor, and then to upgrade your
packages to their latest versions. By default, update will not break
compatibility.

For example, let's say packages A and B both depend on version 1.1.0 of package
X. If a new version of A depends on X@2.0.0, but there is no new version of
package B, running `meteor update` will not update A, because doing so will
break package B.

You can pass in the flag `--packages-only` to update only the packages, and not
the release itself. Similarly, you can pass in names of packages
(`meteor update foo:kittens baz:cats`) to only update specific packages.

Every project is pinned to a specific release of Meteor. You can temporarily try
using your package with another release by passing the `--release` option to any
command; `meteor update` changes the pinned release.

Sometimes, Meteor will ask you to run `meteor update --patch`. Patch releases
are special releases that contain only very minor changes (usually crucial bug
fixes) from previous releases. We highly recommend that you always run `update
--patch` when prompted.

You may also pass the `--release` flag to act as an override to update to a
specific release. This is an override: if it cannot find compatible versions of
packages, it will log a warning, but perform the update anyway. This will only
change your package versions if necessary.


## meteor add  _package_ {meteoradd}

Add packages to your Meteor project. By convention, names of community packages
include the name of the maintainer. For example: `meteor add iron:router`. You
can add multiple packages with one command.

Optionally, adds version constraints. Running `meteor add package@1.1.0` will
add the package at version `1.1.0` or higher (but not `2.0.0` or higher). If you
want to use version `1.1.0` exactly, use `meteor add package@=1.1.0`. You can also
'or' constraints together: for example, `meteor add 'package@=1.0.0 || =2.0.1'`
means either 1.0.0 (exactly) or 2.0.1 (exactly).

To remove a version constraint for a specific package, run `meteor add` again
without specifying a version. For example above, to stop using version `1.1.0`
exactly, run `meteor add package`.


## meteor remove  _package_ {meteorremove}

Removes a package previously added to your Meteor project. For a
list of the packages that your application is currently using, run
`meteor list`.

This removes the package entirely. To continue using the package,
but remove its version constraint, use [`meteor add`](#meteor-add-package).

Meteor does not downgrade transitive dependencies unless it's necessary. This
means that if running `meteor add A` upgrades A's parent package X to a new
version, your project will continue to use X at the new version even after you
run `meteor remove A`.


## meteor list {meteorlist}

Lists all the packages that you have added to your project. For each package,
lists the version that you are using. Lets you know if a newer version of that
package is available.

**Flags**

Flags are optional and can be used to format the output. The default output
requires no flags whatsoever. The following flags are supported:

`--tree`

Outputs a tree showing how packages are referenced.

`--json`

Outputs an unformatted JSON String, showing how packages are referenced.

`--weak`

Show weakly referenced dependencies in the tree.
Only functional in combination with `--tree` or `--json`.

`--details`

Adds more package details to the JSON output.
Only functional in combination with `--json`.


## meteor add-platform  _platform_ {meteoraddplatform}

Adds platforms to your Meteor project. You can add multiple
platforms with one command. Once a platform has been added, you
can use 'meteor run <i>platform</i>' to run on the platform, and `meteor build`
to build the Meteor project for every added platform.


## meteor remove-platform  _platform_ {meteorremoveplatform}

Removes a platform previously added to your Meteor project. For a
list of the platforms that your application is currently using, see
`meteor list-platforms`.


## meteor list-platforms {meteorlistplatforms}

Lists all of the platforms that have been explicitly added to your project.


## meteor ensure-cordova-dependencies {meteorensurecordovadependencies}

Check if the dependencies are installed, otherwise install them.

## meteor mongo {meteormongo}

Open a MongoDB shell on your local development database, so that you
can view or manipulate it directly.

::: warning
For now, you must already have your application running locally
with `meteor run`. This will be easier in the future.
:::


## meteor reset {meteorreset}

Reset the current project to a fresh state and clear the local cache.

To remove also the local mongo database use `--db` flag.

::: warning
Reset with `--db` flag deletes your data! Make sure you do not have any information you
care about in your local mongo database by running `meteor mongo`.
From the mongo shell, use `show collections`
and <code>db.<i>collection</i>.find()</code> to inspect your data.
:::

::: warning
For now, you can not run this while a development server is
running. Quit all running meteor applications before running this.
:::


## meteor build {meteorbuild}

Package this project up for deployment. The output is a directory with several
build artifacts:

<ul><li>a tarball (.tar.gz) that includes everything necessary to run the application
  server (see the <code>README</code> in the tarball for details).  Using the
  `--directory` option will produce a `bundle` directory instead of the tarball.</li>
<li>an unsigned <code>apk</code> bundle and a project source if Android is targeted as a
  mobile platform</li>
<li>a directory with an Xcode project source if iOS is targeted as a mobile
  platform</li></ul>

You can use the application server bundle to host a Meteor application on your
own server, instead of deploying to Galaxy.  You will have to deal
with logging, monitoring, backups, load-balancing, etc, all of which we handle
for you if you use Galaxy.

The unsigned `apk` bundle and the outputted Xcode project can be used to deploy
your mobile apps to Android Play Store and Apple App Store.

By default, your application is bundled for your current architecture.
This may cause difficulties if your app contains binary code due to,
for example, npm packages. You can try to override that behavior
with the `--architecture` flag.

You can set optional data for the initial value of `Meteor.settings`
in your mobile application with the `--mobile-settings` flag. A new value for
`Meteor.settings` can be set later by the server as part of hot code push.

You can also specify which platforms you want to build with the `--platforms` flag.
Examples: `--platforms=android`, `--platforms=ios`, `--platforms=web.browser`.

## meteor lint {meteorlint}

Run through the whole build process for the app and run all linters the app
uses. Outputs all build errors or linting warnings to the standard output.


## meteor search {meteorsearch}

Searches for Meteor packages and releases, whose names contain the specified
regular expression.


## meteor show {meteorshow}

Shows more information about a specific package or release: name, summary, the
usernames of its maintainers, and, if specified, its homepage and git URL.

Get information on meteor recommended releases:
```bash
meteor show METEOR
```

Get information on all meteor releases (including intermediate releases)"
```bash
meteor show --show-all METEOR
```


## meteor publish {meteorpublish}

Publishes your package. To publish, you must `cd` into the package directory, log
in with your Meteor Developer Account and run `meteor publish`. By convention,
published package names must begin with the maintainer's Meteor Developer
Account username and a colon, like so: `iron:router`.

To publish a package for the first time, use `meteor publish --create`.

Sometimes packages may contain binary code specific to an architecture (for
example, they may use an npm package). In that case, running publish will only
upload the build to the architecture that you were using to publish it. You can
use `publish-for-arch` to upload a build to a different architecture from a
different machine.

If you have already published a package but need to update it's metadata
(the content of `Package.describe`) or the README you can actually achieve this
via `meteor publish --update`.

## meteor publish-for-arch {meteorpublishforarch}

Publishes a build of an existing package version from a different architecture.

Some packages contain code specific to an architecture. Running `publish` by
itself, will upload the build to the architecture that you were using to
publish. You need to run `publish-for-arch` from a different architecture to
upload a different build.

For example, let's say you published name:cool-binary-blob from a Mac. If you
want people to be able to use cool-binary-blob from Linux, you should log into a
Linux machine and then run
`meteor publish-for-arch name:cool-binary-blob@version`.  It will notice that you
are on a linux machine, and that there is no Linux-compatible build for your package
and publish one.

Currently, the supported architectures for Meteor are 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux
and Mac OS. Galaxy's servers run 64-bit Linux.


## meteor publish-release {meteorpublishrelease}

Publishes a release of Meteor. Takes in a JSON configuration file.

Meteor releases are divided into tracks. While only MDG members can publish to
the default Meteor track, anyone can create a track of their own and publish to
it. Running `meteor update` without specifying the `--release` option will not
cause the user to switch tracks.

To publish to a release track for the first time, use the `--create-track` flag.

The JSON configuration file must contain the name of the release track
(`track`), the release version (`version`), various metadata, the packages
specified by the release as mapped to versions (`packages`), and the package &
version of the Meteor command-line tool (`tool`). Note that this means that
forks of the meteor tool can be published as packages and people can use them by
switching to a corresponding release. For more information, run
`meteor help publish-release`.


## meteor test-packages {meteortestpackages}

Test Meteor packages, either by name, or by directory. Not specifying an
argument will run tests for all local packages. The results are displayed in an
app that runs at `localhost:3000` by default. If you need to, you can pass the
`--settings` and `--port` arguments.


## meteor admin {meteoradmin}

Catch-all for miscellaneous commands that require authorization to use.

Some example uses of `meteor admin` include adding and removing package
maintainers and setting a homepage for a package. It also includes various
helpful functions for managing a Meteor release.  Run `meteor help admin` for
more information.

## meteor shell {meteorshell}

When `meteor shell` is executed in an application directory where a server
is already running, it connects to the server and starts an interactive
shell for evaluating server-side code.

Multiple shells can be attached to the same server. If no server is
currently available, `meteor shell` will keep trying to connect until it
succeeds.

Exiting the shell does not terminate the server. If the server restarts
because a change was made in server code, or a fatal exception was
encountered, the shell will restart along with the server. This behavior
can be simulated by typing `.reload` in the shell.

The shell supports tab completion for global variables like `Meteor`,
`Mongo`, and `Package`. Try typing `Meteor.is` and then pressing tab.

The shell maintains a persistent history across sessions. Previously-run
commands can be accessed by pressing the up arrow.

## meteor npm {meteornpm}

The `meteor npm` command calls the
[`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) version bundled
with Meteor itself.

Additional parameters can be passed in the same way as the `npm` command
(e.g. `meteor npm rebuild`, `meteor npm ls`, etc.) and the
[npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) should be consulted for the
full list of commands and for a better understanding of their usage.

For example, executing `meteor npm install lodash --save` would install `lodash`
from npm to your `node_modules` directory and save its usage in your
[`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file.

Using the `meteor npm ...` commands in place of traditional `npm ...` commands
is particularly important when using Node.js modules that have binary
dependencies that make native C calls (like [`bcrypt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt))
because doing so ensures that they are built using the same libraries.

Additionally, this access to the npm that comes with Meteor avoids the need to
download and install npm separately.

## meteor node {meteornode}

The `meteor node` command calls the
[`node`](https://nodejs.org) version bundled with Meteor itself.

> This is not to be confused with [`meteor shell`](#meteor-shell), which provides
> an almost identical experience but also gives you access to the "server" context
> of a Meteor application. Typically, `meteor shell` will be preferred.

Additional parameters can be passed in the same way as the `node` command, and
the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/cli.html)
should be consulted for the full list of commands and for a better understanding
of their usage.

For example, executing `meteor node` will enter the Node.js
[Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/repl.html)
interface and allow you to interactively run JavaScript and see the results.

Executing `meteor node -e "console.log(process.versions)"` would
run `console.log(process.versions)` in the version of `node` bundled with Meteor.

## meteor profile {meteorprofile}

The `meteor profile` command runs a performance profile for the Meteor application,
monitoring the bundler process and tracking key performance metrics to help analyze
the build and bundling performance.

The options for this command are the same as those for the `meteor run` command.
You can pass typical runtime options (such as --settings, --exclude-archs, etc.)
to customize the profiling process.

You can use `--size` to monitor both the bundle runtime and `--size-only` to monitor
only the bundle size, allowing you to assess the impact of changes on the overall build
size.

Use `METEOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` to set a timeout for profiling. The default time (90s)
is usually enough for each build step to complete. If you encounter errors due to
early exits, adjust the environment variable accordingly.

Use `METEOR_CLIENT_ENTRYPOINT=<path-to-file>` to set a custom client entrypoint, and
`METEOR_SERVER_ENTRYPOINT=<path-to-file>` to set a custom server entrypoint. By default,
it uses the server and client entrypoints specified in your package.json.

Use `METEOR_LOG_DIR=<path-to-directory>` to set a custom log directory.
