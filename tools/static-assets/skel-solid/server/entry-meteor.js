/**
 * Entrypoint for the Meteor server
 * Generally, this file can be left empty. Vite will add imports for your app's
 * server bundle here during both development and production build.
 *
 * Use ./main.js as the primary entrypoint for your app to take full advantage
 * of Vite's plugin and build system.
 *
 * This can also be a good place to put code that you don't want Vite to
 * process, for example, if you run into a compatability issue or need to use
 * nested imports.
