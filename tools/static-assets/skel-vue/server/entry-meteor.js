// Entrypoint for the Meteor server
// Generally, this file can be left empty. Vite will add imports for
// lazy-loaded Meteor packages to this file to ensure they are included in your
// final production bundle.

// This can also be a good place to put code that you don't want Vite to
// process, for example, if you run into a compatability issue or need to use
// nested imports.
