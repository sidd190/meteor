/**
 * Entrypoint for the Meteor client
 *
 * Generally, this file can be left empty. Vite will add imports for
 * lazy-loaded Meteor packages to this file to ensure they aren't omitted from
 * the final production bundle.
 *
 * Use ./main.js as the primary entrypoint for your client code to take full
 * advantage of Vite's plugin and build system.
 *
 * This can also be a good place to put code that you don't want Vite to
 * process, for example, if you run into a compatibility issue or need to use
 * nested imports which Vite doesn't support.
